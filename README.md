Project’s website: https://github.com/hennok129/RoboticArm

Date of Submission: TBA

Declaration of Joint Authorship
===============================

The F.I.M.P. robotic arm project consist of three group members (Hennok Tadesse,
Tanav Sharma, and Alay Lad) and is a joint effort on the completion of the
project. The work for the project has been divided equally among the group
members. Alay Lad has worked on the hardware aspect of the project; which
includes working with the flex sensors, creating the PCB’s, and working with the
servo motors for the robotic arm. Hennok Tadesse has worked on the design and
functionality of the mobile application. Tanav Sharma has worked on the database
in terms of setting it up, connecting it with the app and maintaining it.
Testing and maintenance for the hardware and software has been tested by all
three members equally and all project updates and changes have been checked and
approved by all members.

 

Approved Proposal
=================

September, 2016

*Proposal for the development of FIMP*

Prepared by Tanav, Alay, and Hennok  
*Computer Engineering Technology Student*  
github.com/hennok129/RoboticArm

**Executive Summary**

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the software app that will connect to a hardware as well as to a mobile
device application. In the app, we will have incorporated a controller that will
be used to control the hardware. The database will store the coordinates of the
robot arm and the angles that the motor and arms need to be when it returns to
rest position. The mobile device functionality will include some very basic test
functions and commands to move the arm. It will create logs and save that data,
so the developer can later look it at and make improvements to the hardware or
software and other users can use these logs to reproduce experiments. In the
winter semester I plan to form a group with the following students (Alay Lad,
Hennok Tadesse, and Tanav Sharma), who are also making similar app this term and
working on the mobile application with Tanav Sharma, Alay Lad, and Hennok
Tadesse. The hardware will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production
Techniques independently and the application will be completed in CENG 319
Software Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent term in
CENG 355 Computer Systems Project as a member of a 3 student group.

**Background**

This project will solve many problems. Along with solving problems it will also
be very innovative. It will help gamers with better precision, and interact with
games. Scientists and engineers can use this arm, for experiments where they
need to have certain amount of distance clearance from the test site. The app
will be saving information received from the arm, and provide logs, so the user
can use it to make his/her reports and also use the information to make changes
to better the app or hardware.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” and have found and read three articles which provides
insight into similar efforts.

The first article is about a continuous-time decentralized neural control scheme
for trajectory tracking of a two degrees of freedom direct drive vertical
robotic arm. (\@7762884)

The second article is about the Gesture Controlled Robot (GCR) which is a robot
that can be moved according to our hand movements. (\@7583873)

The third article is about the instantaneous current profile tracking control
for minimizing torque ripple of switched reluctance motors. (\@6527176)

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

**Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the winter semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

Abstract
========

The purpose of the fully innovated microprocessor (F.I.M.P.) project is to use
and control robotic arm equipment from a safer environment to lower the risk of
work place injuries. The technical report will go over the way the Fully
Innovated Micro Processor(F.I.M.P.) robotic arm project works and the main
components and features of the project. Components such as the flex sensors,
mobile app, and the robotic arm will all be explained in great detail. The four
flex sensors will be attached to a glove that will control the robotic arm with
pressure from the user’s fingers. The mobile app will also be used to control
the robotic arm but with four sliding bars instead of a sensor. The mobile app
will include features such as allowing the user to record logs. The robotic arm
will consist of acrylic parts and four micro servo motors that move each joint
of the robotic arm. The robotic arm is then connected to a Raspberry Pi 3 that
will be the middle point that will control the robotic arm whether its from the
flex sensors or the mobile app. These three key components are the main focus of
the technical report because it will go over the basic workings of the project
and give users the full understanding of this project.

### 1.1 Technical Problem

We have innovated technology to great measures and even till this day, inventors
and innovators continue to improve our lives with technology. Jobs such as an
Aircraft Engineer or a Power line Technician put their lives at risk, by working
up-close dangerous moving parts and high amounts of voltage. Due to these
dangers, employees' are getting injured at the workplace. With the help of
Robotic Arm, we aim to prevent these injuries from happening.

 

### 1.2 The Why

This project was undertaken because using a robotic arm that can be controlled
via mobile app or with a glove, prevents from injury/death as it allows the
technicians to work from a safe distance. It also allows them to have similar
precision as they would have had when they were actually there.

 

### 1.3 Problems Encountered

There were many problems we encountered while working on this project. Some of
these issues involved us burning our motors due to incorrect voltages applied.
Our main problem came was when we attempted to connect the app and hardware. We
also had issues with allowing the Raspberry Pi connect to an enterprise network,
but this issue was resolved by running a simple bash program.

### Introduction

This project will solve many problems. Along with solving problems it will also
be very innovative. It will help gamers with better precision, and interact with
games. With the haptic feedback feature it will create a real life experience
for the user and allow them to make better decisions. Scientists and engineers
can use this arm, for experiments where they need to have certain amount of
distance clearance from the test site. It can also withstand great amounts of
temperature that the normal human hand or body wont be able to bear. Scientists
can deal with hot object like lava rocks, or other hot surfaces. These arms can
also be used in space, where the astronauts can use the arm from their space
ship. With the help of the app, and the integrated camera it will allow users to
interact with the environments outside of their reach, and capabilities. Also
the app will be saving information received from the arm, and provide logs, so
the user can use it to make his/her reports and also use the information to make
changes to better the app or hardware.

 

### Budget

The budget was planned to be under 200\$ Canadian dollars, unfortunately I
surpassed that limit and had to get a new Raspberry Pi and few other items so my
budget has increased slightly.

### Mechanical Assembly

**STEP 1**

The MeArm should be fun to build and easy to control. We’ve spent a lot of time
putting together instructions for building and controlling the MeArm. We advise
that you work out and test how to control your Servo Motors before constructing
your MeArm. It will save you time and frustration, and lessen the chance that
your MeArm will just be something cool to sit on your shelf.

*Using A Flex sensor and Servo On The Raspberry Pi Using An MCP3008*

*MCP3008*

In order to measure the X and Y voltages I decided to use an MCP3008 10 bit
Analogue to Digital Converter. These devices are cheap, easy to setup and allow
8 analogue inputs to be read by the Pi using its SPI interface. In this tutorial
we will only need three of its inputs.

**2.3 Project Breakdown**
-------------------------

### 2.3.1 Database

There will be a Amazon Database; a service provided by Amazon. When creating an
account with Amazone Web Server, I need to create a php file for the register
activity. I also need to create one file for the login activity. To connect the
app to the database, I created a "init.php" file. This file is in charge for
establishing connection to the database. All of these files are in-charge of the
backend process of the database. This database will be responsible for holding
user account information, for example user credentials for the login/register
function. This database will also contain many tables under the user account as
the user will able to create multiple logs with in a day and each log will be
stored in its own table. The breakdown of the fields is stated below.

**User Account**

1.  This table is generated when the user registers

2.  It holds the users first name, last name, username as well as the password.

When registering, if an username already exists on the database, it

will advise the user that “User already exists”. When logging in, if the user
enters wrong credentials, it will advise the user “Wrong Credentials”

**Logs**

1.  This table is generated under the users account and is linked with use
    unique id.

2.  This table is generated when user launches the controller function in the
    app, and is asked if they would like to start a log.

3.  It creates the table with title of the current date and time on the system
    and stores the motors start and end coordinates for each of the four motor.

4.  User will able to create multiple logs with in a day.

The purpose of the database is mainly to allow the user to create a personal
account, and to allow other users to access logs from other users. Creating a
table with the date and time, under the user’s unique id, will inform others
whose logs are being accessed from which date and time. The administrator may
choose to restrict certain logs to certain user and/or departments.

These logs can be used for research/development reasons only, which is stated in
the Terms and Condition document provided with the product and also displayed to
the user when launching the app.

### 2.3.2 Application

The overall concept of the mobile application for the project is to control the four
servo motors of the robotic arm and keep logs on the user’s actions. The first
screen of the application will be the login screen which will require an email and
password to create and login to an account. The accounts are used to hold
individual logs of the user’s controller usage. When logged in, the user is
presented with two option; controller and user logs.

The first option of the application is to control the motor with four sliders
that will control the arms movements. When the application first begins, the
sliders will be set to a default (centered) position. When exiting the
application, the robotic arm will return to its default position after all
created movements.

During the controller screen, the application will have logs of the user’s usage
and will be presented in the user log screen. The user logs will contain the log
of all the users usage of the application based on the users in the database. In
conclusion, the login screen, controller screen, and user logs are the three key
features of the application. The key developer of this application will be
Hennok Tadesse with some help from Tanav Sharma.

### 2.3.3 Hardware

**ROBOTIC ARM**

FIMP project aims to bring a simple Robot Arm well within the reach and budget
of the average educator, student, parent or child. The design brief we set out
with was to build a full robot arm kit with standard low cost screws, low cost
servo motors and using less than 300 x 200mm (\~A4) of acrylic

**MCP3008**

In order to measure the X and Y voltages I decided to use an MCP3008 10 bit
Analogue to Digital Converter. These devices are cheap, easy to setup and allow
8 analogue inputs to be read by the Pi using its SPI interface.

**Adafruit 16-Channel PWM**

The Raspberry Pi is a wonderful little computer, but one thing it isn't very
good at is controlling DC Servo Motors - these motors need very specific and
repetitive timing pulses to set the position. Instead of asking the Pi Linux
kernel to send these signals, pop on this handy HAT! It adds the capability to
control 16 Servos with perfect timing. It can also do PWM up to 1.6 KHz with 12
bit precision, all completely free-running.

**Flex Sensor 4.5**

A simple flex sensor 4.5" in length. As the sensor is flexed, the resistance
across the sensor increases. Patented technology by Spectra Symbol - they claim
these sensors were used in the original Nintendo Power Glove.

The resistance of the flex sensor changes when the metal pads are on the outside
of the bend.

**2.4 Progress Reports**
------------------------

 

**3. Conclusion**
-----------------
This project was aimed to create a safer work environment for engineers and technicians, and to create a fun educational experience for the general public. We wanted to reduce the rate of work place injuries, and could not have thought of a better way. This F.I.M.P Arm has one main function, to give the user the ability to perform their job/task with ease and safely. The arm consists of four motors, which is connected to the 4 flex sensors in the glove. As the user flex’s their fingers, it sends the values from the sensor to the motors to mimic the motion. The arm can also be controlled via Android application, which connects to the arm via Bluetooth. The application controls the values with four sliding bars, the application allows the user to start a log and send the values of the motor to the database, which can be later viewed for report/diagnostic purposes. The final version of our project meets all the requirements that are needed to complete/rebuild this project.
