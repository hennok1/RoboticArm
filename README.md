*Proposal for the development of Project Name*

Prepared by Tanav, Alay, and Hennok  
*Computer Engineering Technology Student*

**Executive Summary**

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the software app that will connect to a hardware as well as to a mobile
device application. In the app, we will have camera incorporated along with a
controller that will be used to control the hardware. The database will store
the coordinates of the robot arm and the angles that the motor and arms need to
be when it returns to rest position. The mobile device functionality will
include some very basic test functions and commands to move the arm. It will log
any lags or imperfections and save that data, so the developer can later look it
at and make improvements to the hardware or software. In the winter semester I
plan to form a group with the following students (Alay Lad, Hennok Tadesse, and
Tanav Sharma), who are also making similar app this term and working on the
mobile application with Tanav Sharma, Alay Lad, and Hennok Tadesse. The hardware
will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production Techniques independently and
the application will be completed in CENG 319 Software Project. These will be
integrated together in the subsequent term in CENG 355 Computer Systems Project
as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.

**Background**

This project will solve many problems. Along with solving problems it will also
be very innovative. It will help gamers with better precision, and interact with
games. With the haptic feedback feature it will create a real life experience
for the user and allow them to make better decisions. Scientists and engineers
can use this arm, for experiments where they need to have certain amount of
distance clearance from the test site. It can also withstand great amounts of
temperature that the normal human hand or body won’t be able to bear. Scientists
can deal with hot object like lava rocks, or other hot surfaces. These arms can
also be used in space, where the astronauts can use the arm from their space
ship. Also the app will be saving information received from the arm, and provide
logs, so the user can use it to make his/her reports and also use the
information to make changes to better the app or hardware.

The first article is about a continuous-time decentralized neural control scheme
for trajectory tracking of a two degrees of freedom direct drive vertical
robotic arm.[@7762884]

The second article is about the Gesture Controlled Robot (GCR) which is a robot
that can be moved according to our hand movements. [@7583873]

The third article is about the instantaneous current profile tracking control
for minimizing torque ripple of switched reluctance motors. [@6527176]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

**Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

**Concluding remarks**

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for creating and
testing solutions for complete physical tasks. This is an opportunity to
integrate the knowledge and skills developed in our program to create a
collaborative IoT capstone project demonstrating my ability to learn how to
support projects such as the initiative described by [2]. I request approval of
this project.

### Application Breakdown

The overall concept of the mobile app for the project is to control the four
servo motors of the robotic arm and keep logs on the user’s actions. The first
screen of the app will be the login screen which will require an email and
password to create and login to an account. The accounts are used to hold
individual logs of the user’s controller usage. When logged in, the user is
presented with two option; controller and user logs.

The first option of the application is to control the motor with four sliders
that will control the arms movements. When the application first begins, the
sliders will be set to a default (centered) position. When exiting the
application, the robotic arm will return to its default position after all
created movements. During the controller screen, the application will have logs
of the user’s usage and will be presented in the user log screen. The user logs
will contain the log of all the users usage of the app based on the users in the
database.

Overall, the login screen, controller screen, and user logs are the three key
features of the application. The main developers of this application will be
Hennok Tadesse with help from Tanav Sharma for integrating the database into the
application.

### Database Breakdown

There will be a Firebase Database; a service provided by google. When creating
an account with Google Firebase, a file with the name of “google-services.json”
is downloaded and needs to be imported into application project. This file is
in-charge of the backend process of the database. This database will be
responsible for holding user account information, for example user credentials
for the login/register function. This database may contain many tables under the
user account as the user will able to create multiple logs with in a day and
each log will be stored in a table. The breakdown of the fields is stated below.

**1.       User Account**

a.       This table is generated when the user registers

b.      It holds the users email address as well as the hash password entered

 

When registering, if an email address already exists on the database, it will
advise the user “User already exists”. When logging in, if the user enters wrong
credentials, it will advise the user “Wrong Credentials”

 

**2.       Logs**

a.       This table is generated under the users account and is linked with user
unique id.

b.      This table is generated when user launches the controller function in
the app, and is asked if they would like to start a log.

c.       It creates the table with title of the current date and time on the
system and stores the motors x, y coordinates for each of the four motor.

d.      User will able to create multiple logs with in a day. 

The purpose of the database is mainly to allow the user to create a personal
account, and to allow other users to access logs from other users. Creating a
table with the date and time, under the user’s unique id, will inform others
whose logs are being accessed from which date and time. The administrator may
choose to restrict certain logs to certain user and/or departments.

These logs can be used for research/development reasons only, which is stated in
the Terms and Condition document provided with the product and also displayed to
the user when launching the app.

### Hardware Breakdown

**MeArm**

The MeArm project aims to bring a simple Robot Arm well within the reach and
budget of the average educator, student, parent or child. The design brief we
set out with was to build a full robot arm kit with standard low cost screws,
low cost servo motors and using less than 300 x 200mm (\~A4) of acrylic

**MCP3008**

In order to measure the X and Y voltages I decided to use an MCP3008 10 bit
Analogue to Digital Converter. These devices are cheap, easy to setup and allow
8 analogue inputs to be read by the Pi using its SPI interface.

 

**Adafruit 16-Channel PWM**

The Raspberry Pi is a wonderful little computer, but one thing it isn't very
good at is controlling DC Servo Motors - these motors need very specific and
repetitive timing pulses to set the position. Instead of asking the Pi Linux
kernel to send these signals, pop on this handy HAT! It adds the capability to
control 16 Servos with perfect timing. It can also do PWM up to 1.6 KHz with 12
bit precision, all completely free-running.

 

**Flex Sensor 4.5**

A simple flex sensor 4.5" in length. As the sensor is flexed, the resistance
across the sensor increases. Patented technology by Spectra Symbol - they claim
these sensors were used in the original Nintendo Power Glove.

The resistance of the flex sensor changes when the metal pads are on the outside
of the bend.
